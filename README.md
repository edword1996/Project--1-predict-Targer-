# Target predict
# Task description
 Task:Scope of this project is to predict as precisely as possible the values of the targets (Target1,Target2) relative to the validation set.
 
# Information about project
The project consists of 5 modules:
- only_function.py;
It's main module. This module stores all other modules and undergoes operations of writing the results to a file.
- pars_data.py
This module is responsible for the fact that it would qualitatively and completely open all files for their further work.
- preprocessing.py
This module is responsible for normalizing and processing data to a state where it can already be trained.
- test_data.py
Here the data is trained on different models.
- train_data.py
We have result on test data.

The main module to run is called only_function.py. It contains all the other modules. After you run the project, you will get 2 folders and 2 files (txt). The folders that you will see after launching they are called (target1_models and target2_models) these folders contain models but you do not need them. To view the result, you need files named (predicted_target1.txt and predicted_target2.txt). You will also see them after launch.

# Conclusion

Pay attention to the results. As mentioned earlier, we have a pretty good result on the training sample. That is, the model learns well.
But we see a bad even negative result on the test. This is the so-called retraining (overfitting).
As a conclusion, we have a very powerful model, aggressive learning rates, based on this, and a bad test.
